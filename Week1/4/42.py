# Starter code

num1 = 25
num2 = 4
print("Enter a number")
num3 = int(input())

total1 = num1 * num2
total2 = num3 + num2
total3 = total1 - total2

# How many variables are used in the code?
  # Answer: 6 (num1, num2, num3, total1, total2, total3)

# Give the line number where an output statement is used.
  # Answer: Line 5

# What symbol is used for variable assignment?
  # Answer: = symbol

# What value is stored in total1 at the end of the program?
  # Answer: 100 (num1 (25) * num2 (4))

# What value is stored in num3 at the end of the program?
  # Answer: The user input (stored as an int).

# Line 8 is changed to total1 = num1 // num2. How would it affect the program?
  # Answer: // is used to divide numbers and round down to the closest int. In this case, line 8 (total1) = 6
