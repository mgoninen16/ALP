#Task 1 - Add comments to the code below to predict what will happen when it is run.

#Task 2 - add comments to the code to explain what the variable(s) are called and where they are used. Make sure to show where the variable.

print("Hi! What's your name?") #When running this print function, the string "Hi! What's your name?" will print to the console.

name = input() #The user input will be stored in the variable "name".

#The value of the user input is saved in the variable "name". The variable is used in the print function below to write a message to the user.

print("Hi " + name + "! How are you today?") #This print function will print "Hi ", plus the value of the "name" variable (what the user inputs), plus "! How are you today?" to the console.
