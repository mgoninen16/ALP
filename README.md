# Topics in Computer Science - Badger Precollege ALP

In July of 2023, I had the pleasure of taking part in the Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) Topics in Computer Science course through Badger Precollege at University of Wisconsin-Madison. I spent just over five hours per day for three weeks in class. In class, we covered the following topics:

-Basics of Python (Strings, Operations, Functions, Variables, Input, For & While Loops, etc.)
-Human Computer Interaction (Low/High Fidelity Designs, Ethnography)
-Cryptography (Caesar, Affine, Substitution, and Vigenere Ciphers)
-Python Libraries for Games and User Interfaces (Gradio, Play, Pygame)
-Large Language Model (LLM) Implementation (Using HuggingFace API with GPT-2, GPT-3.5 API, UI for GPT-3.5, Prompt Engineering)
-Types of Decoding for LLMs (Deterministic, Stochastic, Contrastive Search)
-AI and Programming Ethics
-Basics of Networks (UDP vs TCP, Chunking, Security)
-Data Visualization & Analysis (Python Dictionaries, Databases, Data Analysis with matplotlib)
-Algorithms (such as Binary Search)
-Basics of CMD Line/Terminal, Conda, and Git

For my final project, I used the API for OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model and put it in a program with gTTS (Google Text-To-Speech), playsound, and SpeechRecognition to make an AI Chatbot with Voice Input and Voice Output (in Multiple Languages).

Files from ALL of my work throughout this course can be found in this GitHub Repository.

I would like to thank my teachers Anosh Wasker and Rama Ranganath for teaching this course. Their knowledge has been a valuble asset as I have worked to achieve a basline understanding of programming and computer science theory. I would also like to thank the University of Wisconsin-Madison for setting up this program.
